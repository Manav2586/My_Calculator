## Simple Calculator

This is a simple calculator web application created using HTML, CSS, JavaScript. It is currently a work in progress as I continue to learn and improve my JavaScript skills. The functionality of the calculator includes basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Functionality

- Addition: Allows users to add numbers together.
- Subtraction: Allows users to subtract one number from another.
- Multiplication: Allows users to multiply numbers together.
- Division: Allows users to divide one number by another.

## Future Improvements

While the current version of the calculator is functional, there are several improvements planned for the future to make it more useful and user-friendly:

- Implementing decimal support for more precise calculations.
- Adding memory functions (e.g., store, recall, clear memory).
- Enhancing the user interface with a more modern and intuitive design.
- Adding keyboard support for users who prefer to input calculations using their keyboard.
- Implementing error handling to handle invalid inputs and edge cases.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
3. Use the buttons on the calculator interface to perform calculations.
4. Enjoy exploring the basic functionality of the calculator.
